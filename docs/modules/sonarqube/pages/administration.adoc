= SonarQube Administration

The `ods-core` repository contains a build recipe for a central SonarQube instance to which all Jenkins instances send reports to. The remainder of this document describes how that setup is done.

== Modifying configurations, plugins, etc.

There is an `admin` user which is allowed to change settings, install plugins, etc. The password is located in the OpenShift project `cd`, inside the `sonarqube-app` secret.

== Updating SonarQube to a new version

The SonarQube deployment is using an image built in the central ODS namespace. This image is not based on the https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube[official SonarQube image on DockerHub], because that requires a specific user to be run under. However, the approach ODS takes is similar to the official image, as can be seen in the https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/blob/master/sonarqube/docker/Dockerfile[ODS Dockerfile].

The SonarQube version which is used is determined by which ZIP file is used.

To update SonarQube, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Configure new version
2. Update `BuildConfig`
3. Create new image
4. Rollout new deployment

The following will guide you through this process.

To configure a new version of SonarQube, you need to update the configuration of ODS, which is located in the `ods-configuration` repository of your ODS project in Bitbucket. You need to have the latest `master` of this repository, as well as the `ods-core` repository in your current ODS version available locally. If you don't want to do this manually, you can make use the `repos.sh` script:

[source,sh]
----
UMBRELLA_DIR=~/opendevstack
BITBUCKET_HOST=bitbucket.acme.org
BITBUCKET_PROJECT=opendevstack
GIT_REF=v3.0.0
mkdir -p $UMBRELLA_DIR && cd $UMBRELLA_DIR
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevstack/ods-core/$GIT_REF/scripts/repos.sh
chmod +x repos.sh
./repos.sh --git-ref $GIT_REF --repos="ods-core,ods-configuration" --source-project https://$BITBUCKET_HOST/scm/$BITBUCKET_PROJECT
----

The script can also be used in an umbrella directory in which the repositories already exist. Once the repositories are at the desired revision, change `SONAR_VERSION` and `SONAR_DISTRIBUTION_URL` in `ods-configuration/ods-core.env` to your desired version. Commit the change and push it to Bitbucket.

Next, you should ensure that the SonarQube `BuildConfig` resource in the central ODS namespace is up-to-date, then trigger a new build so that a new image gets built. Finally, a new deployment should be rolled out which uses the newly built image. All of this can be done from the `ods-core` repository:

[source,sh]
----
make install-sonarqube
----

This target depends on the targets `apply-sonarqube-build`, `start-sonarqube-build`, `apply-sonarqube-deploy` and `configure-sonarqube` which execute the steps described above (and can of course also be executed individually).
