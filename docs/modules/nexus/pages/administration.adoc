= Nexus Administration

The `ods-core` repository contains a build recipe for a central Nexus instance. The remainder of this document describes how that setup is done, and how it can be modified and updated.

== Updating Nexus to a new version

The Nexus deployment is using an image built in the central ODS namespace. This image is a https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/blob/master/nexus/docker/Dockerfile[customisation] of the https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3[official Nexus image on DockerHub].

The Nexus version which is used is determined by which image tag from DockerHub is used, and depending on tag, at which time the ODS image is built.

To update Nexus, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Configure new version
2. Update `BuildConfig`
3. Create new image
4. Rollout new deployment

The following will guide you through this process.

To configure a new version of Nexus, you need to update the configuration of ODS, which is located in the `ods-configuration` repository of your ODS project in Bitbucket. You need to have the latest `master` of this repository, as well as the `ods-core` repository in your current ODS version available locally. If you don't want to do this manually, you can make use the `repos.sh` script:

[source,sh]
----
UMBRELLA_DIR=~/opendevstack
BITBUCKET_HOST=bitbucket.acme.org
BITBUCKET_PROJECT=opendevstack
GIT_REF=v3.0.0
mkdir -p $UMBRELLA_DIR && cd $UMBRELLA_DIR
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevstack/ods-core/$GIT_REF/scripts/repos.sh
chmod +x repos.sh
./repos.sh --git-ref $GIT_REF --repos="ods-core,ods-configuration" --source-project https://$BITBUCKET_HOST/scm/$BITBUCKET_PROJECT
----

The script can also be used in an umbrella directory in which the repositories already exist. Once the repositories are at the desired revision, change `NEXUS_FROM_IMAGE` in `ods-configuration/ods-core.env` to your desired image tag. Commit the change and push it to Bitbucket.

Next, you should ensure that the Nexus `BuildConfig` resource in the central ODS namespace is up-to-date, then trigger a new build so that a new image with the changed base image gets built. Finally, a new deployment should be rolled out which uses the newly built image. All of this can be done from the `ods-core` repository:

[source,sh]
----
make install-nexus
----

This target depends on the targets `apply-nexus-build`, `start-nexus-build`, and `apply-nexus-deploy` which execute the steps described above (and can of course also be executed individually).

WARNING: There is also a `configure-nexus` target. However, this is not executed as part of `install-nexus` as it is not idempotent yet (which means it cannot be used against an existing Nexus deployment). For a simple Nexus version update, you don't need to change any configuration, but if you switch between ODS versions you should keep an eye on Nexus configuration.
