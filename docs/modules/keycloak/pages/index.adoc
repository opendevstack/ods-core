Keycloak is an open source identity and access managment tool.

OpenDevStack uses eigther _Atlassian Crowd_ or  _OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0_ protocol for authentication users of provisioning app.

IMPORTANT: The usage of Keycloak is optional. Instead of keycloak, _Atlassian Crowd_ can still be used for
authentication. See documentation under _ODS-Components_ -> _Provisioning App_ -> _Configuration Guide_ regarding
the configuration of provisioning app.


Setup of keycloak for local-installation is all done without further manual setup actions
by starting the vagrant-box _idmanager_.
