= Infrastructure Setup

The infrastructure setup part contains the scripts to setup OpenDevstack.
It uses https://www.ansible.com[Ansible] for installing the Atlassian tools and the provisioning app (including https://www.rundeck.com/open-source[Rundeck].
Setting up an https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html#id2[Ansible control host] is beyond the scope of this document.

Each individual component is set-up using a seperate playbook. So you can decide which playbooks to run, depending on your current environment.

== The different playbooks

We have different playbooks depending on the environment in which you install the Atlassian tools and Rundeck.
The playbooks depend on roles. The roles provide variables for customization. The different variables can be looked up under each role at `default/main.yml`.

.General Playbooks
postgresql.yml::
Sets up a (local) PostgreSQL for use with Atlassian tools.
schemas.yml::
Sets up the required schemas for Atlassian tools
crowd.yml::
Sets up Atlassian Crowd as an Identity and SSO provider
bitbucket.yml::
Sets up Atlassian Bitbucket
jira.yml::
Sets up Atlassian Jira
jira_enable_sso.yml::
After basic setup of Crowd and Jira setup, enable SSO functionality.
confluence.yml::
Sets up Atlassian Confluence
confluence_enable_sso.yml::
After basic setup of Crowd and Confluence setup, enable SSO functionality.

Beside the basic playbooks, it might be required to run additional playbooks if you setup the Atlassian tools on AWS.

.Special Plabyooks

crowd_post_setup.yml::
Takes care that login to crowd is possible by inserting the AWS LB IP addresses into the database tables.


== How to update ansible roles
The ansible role definitions are located in the _ods-core_ repository at https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/infrastructure-setup/ansible/roles[infrastructure-setup/ansible/roles]

Note that there are two different types of roles:

- roles starting with _modified_ or _local_; these roles are modified by the OpenDevStack members and are maintained by them
- all other roles, e.g _geerlingguy.git_, which are copied roles from ansible galaxy.

The roles from ansible galaxy are specified in the https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/blob/master/infrastructure-setup/ansible/requirements.yml[requirements.yml] file.
In order to migrate to a new version of the role, you need to

1. specify the version in the _requirements.yml_ file
2. run _ansible-galaxy install_

*Example: update _geerlingguy.git_ to version 2.1.0*

.Update requirements.yml:
[source,sh]
----
- src: geerlingguy.git
  version: 2.1.0
----

.Call _ansible-galaxy install_:
[source,sh]
----
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=/vagrant/ansible/.vault_pass.txt && ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p roles
