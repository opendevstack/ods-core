== What is OpenDevStack?

When we started with https://www.openshift.com/[RedHat's OpenShift] we were blown away by the 100s of possibilities to use it, but there was not anything along the lines of "This is how you make it work for your org". Its catalog provides items for almost everything - yet what we wanted is to enable people to quickly introduce Continous Delivery and standardized technology archetypes. We call this lean, empowered governance.

So what does OpenDevStack provide?

- Everyting you need for CI infrastructure (Jenkins images, SonarQube, Nexus).
- Ansible playbooks to install the Atlassian suite (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, Crowd).
- A shared xref:jenkins-shared-library:index.adoc[jenkins library] that harmonizes the way you build, test, govern and deploy.
- A set of xref:quickstarters:index.adoc[technology quickstarters] that provide complete CI/CD integration, w/o anything to worry about for the engineer.
- A small xref:provisioning-app:index.adoc[provisioning application] that gives you one place to start, no matter if you want to start a new project, or enhance an existing one with a quickstarter.

== Using OpenDevStack
=== Create a new project

Trigger project creation through the xref:provisioning-app:index.adoc[provisioning application] to get a new project. The web GUI of the provisioning app is located at `https://prov-app-ods.example.com`.

When "Create Openshift Project" is checked, this will also create OpenShift projects, namely `<project-key>-dev` and `<project-key>-test`.
A Jenkins deployment will be created in the `<project-key>-cd` project to allow each project full freedom of build management. This deployment is based on a common Jenkins image from the central ODS namespace.

=== Create a new component within a project (using a quickstarter)

Open the web GUI of the provisioning app `https://prov-app-ods.example.com`.
Select your project, then choose a xref:quickstarters:index.adoc[quickstarter]. If no framework fits to your needs, choose the xref:quickstarters:docker-plain.adoc[docker-plain quickstarter].

After provisioning the quickstarter, you'll have a new repository in your BitBucket project with the boilerplate of the component. From that, a Jenkins job is triggered automatically (via a webhook setup in Bitbucket) which builds and deploys the boilerplate application into the `<project-key>-dev` project.

== Versioning

OpenDevStack is released roughly every half year. Each release is identified by a "major version" such as `2`, `3`, `4` and so on. As a consumer of OpenDevStack, you can either:

- point to `master` to follow the cutting edge
- point to `2.x`, `3.x`, etc. to stay on a major version, but get bug fixes
- point to `v2.0`, `v3.0`, etc. to pin an exact version
- use a custom branch / tag such as `2.acme` or `3.custom` etc. to run ODS with customizations

== Roadmap

Each version is tracked as a https://github.com/orgs/opendevstack/projects[GitHub project]. The current major version is 2, the next one will be 3.

=== https://github.com/orgs/opendevstack/projects/9[3] (to be released June 2020)

- Rename central namespace to `ODS`, and extend with running provisioning app
- Install provisioning app and document generation service from pre-built images
- Quickstarter pipeline
- Merge of MRO (now: orchestration) pipeline into general shared pipeline
- Automation of SonarQube and Nexus setup
- Decorate Bitbucket pull requests with SonarQube analysis

=== https://github.com/orgs/opendevstack/projects/6[2] (December 2019)

- Removal of Rundeck (replace with Jenkins jobs)
- New quickstarter concept (multiple repo support)
- Project specific technical users
- CPU and memory quota support
