= PVC Migration

This document describes the process to migrate data from one Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to another within the OpenShift cluster.

== Prerequisites

- Ensure the source and target PVCs exist in the desired namespace.
- Have access to the `ods-core` repository.

== Migration Process

To migrate data between PVCs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `ods-core` repository.
2. Run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
make migrate-pvc-data SOURCE_PVC=<source-pvc-name> TARGET_PVC=<target-pvc-name>
----

Replace `<source-pvc-name>`, and `<target-pvc-name>` with the appropriate values for your environment.

== Details

- The migration process creates a temporary pod that uses `rsync` to copy data from the source PVC to the target PVC.
- Logs of the migration are stored in `/tmp/target/rsync.log` within the target PVC.
- After the migration, verify the data integrity and delete the temporary pod if necessary.
