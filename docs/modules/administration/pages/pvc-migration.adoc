= PVC Migration

This document describes the process to migrate data from one Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to another within the OpenShift cluster.

== Prerequisites

- Ensure the source and target PVCs exist in the desired namespace.
- Have access to the `ods-core` repository.

== Migration Process

To migrate data between PVCs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `ods-core` repository.
2. Run the following command:

[source,sh]
----
make migrate-pvc-data SOURCE_PVC=<source-pvc-name> TARGET_PVC=<target-pvc-name> [THREADS=<num-threads>] [CPU_REQUEST=<num-cpu>]
----

Replace `<source-pvc-name>`, `<target-pvc-name>`, `<num-threads>`, and `<num-cpu>` with the appropriate values for your environment.
- `THREADS` (optional): Number of parallel threads to use for migration (default: 5).
- `CPU_REQUEST` (optional): Number of CPU cores to request for the migration pod (default: 1).

== Details

- The migration process creates a temporary pod that uses parallelized `rsync` to copy data from the source PVC to the target PVC.
- You can control the number of parallel threads and CPU resources via the `THREADS` and `CPU_REQUEST` options.
- After the migration, verify the data integrity and delete the temporary pod.
