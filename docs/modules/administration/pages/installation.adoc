= OpenDevStack Setup

This document will guide you through installing / maintaining an OpenDevStack installation.

== Server prerequisites

Installing OpenShift is out of scope for this guide. We assume you have an OpenShift 3.11 cluster running already. If so, ensure that the cluster nodes have `vm.max_map_count` set to at least `262144`, otherwise you'll not be able to install SonarQube later on. You may change this setting via `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`.

TIP: If you do not have an OpenShift cluster yet, and just want to try things out, you may use `oc cluster up` to spin up a temporary cluster. Note that this will only work on Linux and we recommend to have at least 16GB RAM and 32GB of available disk space.

== Local Setup

IMPORTANT: From now on we assume you work from a Bash terminal (Cygwin / Linux). In this terminal, you'll ned a recent `git` version (>= 2.13.2) and a recent `jq` version (>= 1.5, see https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) in your `$PATH`.

=== Repositories

Before you can install OpenDevStack (no matter whether locally or on another server) you need to have the ODS repositories available on your local machine.

For this purpose, ODS provides a script to setup all required repositories with the same Git ref easily.
This script needs to be downloaded to the umbrella directory which should hold all ODS respositories.
The following example shows how to do this for the `master` version, please use the exact version you want to install (e.g. `v4.0.0`):

[source,sh]
----
UMBRELLA_DIR=~/opendevstack
GIT_REF=master
mkdir -p $UMBRELLA_DIR && cd $UMBRELLA_DIR
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevstack/ods-core/$GIT_REF/scripts/repos.sh
chmod +x repos.sh
./repos.sh --git-ref $GIT_REF
----

After running this script, all required repositories should be available locally.

=== Configuration

Go to `ods-core` and run:
[source,sh]
----
make prepare-config
----

If you want to install OpenDevStack for the first time, leave the BitBucket URL empty.

After the configuration is prepared (which means that a directory `ods-configuration` will be created if it does not exist yet),
fill out all the parameters in `ods-core.env` in directory `ods-configuration` for your installation.
Add all files of directory `ods-configuration` to git and commit the result. You don't need to push yet, this will be done later.

"Preparing" also updates the sample files and checks if any params are present in the sample files but missing from the real file.

WARNING: If you are using windows **Cygwin** or **WSL** remember to change ending line CRLF to LF before commit `ods-core.env`, you can find more information on https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings[configure Git ending line]

== Atlassian Suite
At this stage you have to setup the Atlassian suite (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Crowd) if it does not exist yet. If you already have an installation the Atlassian suite, you now need to configure it to work with OpenDevStack.

WARNING: Documentation for the installation and configuration of the Atlassian suite is missing at the moment. The general setup is described in https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/infrastructure-setup, but this will likely need adaption to your specific environment.

After Crowd is running, ensure that there is a user corresponding to the `CD_USER_ID_B64`/`CD_USER_PWD_B64` parameters in `ods-core.env`.

== Bitbucket Repositories

On Bitbucket, there must be an `OPENDEVSTACK` project filled with the necessary repositories such as `ods-core`. To set them up, use:

[source,sh]
----
make prepare-bitbucket-repos
----

Notice that `prepare-bitbucket-repos` expects a running Atlassian suite (it will *not* spin up a new Bitbucket instance).

Then, update them with the latest state so that they can be used e.g. from `BuildConfig` resources in OpenShift:
[source,sh]
----
make push-local-repos
----

You also need to update `ods-configuration`, which can be done via:
[source,sh]
----
git remote add origin <bitbucket-ods-configuration-git-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
----

Finally, it is required to create a Git ref in the `ods-jenkins-shared-library` which matches the ODS version you want your users to consume (as specified by `ODS_IMAGE_TAG` in the configuration):
[source,sh]
----
make set-shared-library-ref
----


== OpenDevStack environment in OpenShift

=== Tailor

We use https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor] to handle OpenShift templates and keep OpenDevStack resources in sync. Tailor is a tool which needs to be installed on your local machine. Please see its https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor#installation[installation instructions] for your platform. Following are the version requirements:

|===
| OpenDevStack version | Tailor version

| 3.x
| >= 1.2.2

| 2.x
| >= 0.13.1

| 1.2.x
| = 0.9.3

| 1.1.x
| = 0.9.3

| 1.0.x
| = 0.9.1

| 0.1.x
| = 0.8
|===

=== Central ODS project

OpenDevStack needs one central project in OpenShift, which will hold all shared resources such as images or deployments. This project is typically called `ods`, but you can customize this in the configuration via `ODS_NAMESPACE`.

NOTE: For the following steps, you must be logged into OpenShift (using `oc login <host> --token=<token>`) with a user that has **cluster-admin** rights.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-ods-project
----


=== Nexus

A central Nexus deployment is used to proxy packages and to store artifacts.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-nexus
----

Afterwards, run the initial configuration:
[source,sh]
----
make configure-nexus
----

In the course of this you will be prompted to set a new admin password.

WARNING: The `configure-nexus` target is not idempotent yet, so it cannot be used for upgrading!

=== SonarQube

A central SonarQube deployment is used to analyze source code.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-sonarqube
----

This will launch an instance of SonarQube.
The script will prompt for a new admin password. Once this has been set, an auth token for the Jenkins pipelines will be generated.
Both values are automatically written into `ods-configuration/ods-core.env`, which you then need to commit and push.

Also, you have to add the cd-user as a user in the project permissions of your Bitbucket OpenDevStack project. Read permission is sufficient.

=== Jenkins

Central Jenkins images (master, agent, webhook proxy) are used by every ODS project.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-jenkins
----

Then, there are further Jenkins agent images for each quickstarter technology.

To create those images, run the following from `ods-quickstarters`:
[source,sh]
----
make install-jenkins-agent
----

=== Document Generation service
At this stage you can setup or modify the image stream for the Document Generation service.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-doc-gen
----

=== Provisioning Application
At this stage you can setup or modify the provisioning application.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-provisioning-app
----


Congratulations! At this point you should have a complete ODS installation. Try it out by provisioning a new project with the provisioning application.
