= OpenDevStack Setup

This document will guide you through installing / maintaining an OpenDevStack installation.

NOTE: From now on we assume, you work from a Bash (Cygwin / Linux).

== Server prerequisites

In order to run the Atlassian suite and OpenShift, your host must have:

- At least 16GB RAM and 32GB of available disk space
- `vm.max_map_count=262144` to run SonarQube (which can be set via `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`)
- A recent `git` version (>= 2.13.2)
- A recent `jq` version (>= 1.5, see https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

== Local Setup

Before you can install OpenDevStack (no matter whether locally or on another server) you need to have the sources available on your local machine.

=== Repositories

If you do not have the ODS repositories setup yet, you can run `repos.sh` file. Before you run this script, keep in mind to have Git (>=2.13). Once you have that, you can then go to your Terminal and run:
[source,sh]
----
mkdir -p opendevstack
cd opendevstack
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendevstack/ods-core/master/ods-setup/repos.sh
chmod +x repos.sh
----

If you are installing OpenDevStack for the first time, run:
[source,sh]
----
./repos.sh --init
----

If there is already an existing installation of OpenDevStack, run the following with a user that has write permission:
[source,sh]
----
./repos.sh
----

The script will prompt you which Git ref you want to use. Select either `master` for bleeding edge or a more stable "version" such as `2.x`. Afterwards running this script, all required repositories should be available locally.

=== Configuration

Go to `ods-core` and run:
[source,sh]
----
make prepare-config
----

If you want to install OpenDevStack for the first time, leave the BitBucket URL empty.

After the configuration is prepared (which means that a directory `ods-configuration` will be created if it does not exist yet),
fill out all the parameters in `ods-core.env` in directory `ods-configuration` for your installation.
Add all files of directory `ods-configuration` to git and commit the result. You don't need to push yet, this will be done later.

"Preparing" also updates the sample files and checks if any params are present in the sample files but missing from the real file.

WARNING: If you are using windows **Cygwin** or **WSL** remember to change ending line CRLF to LF before commit `ods-core.env`, you can find more information on https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings[configure Git ending line]

=== Tailor

We use https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor] to handle OpenShift templates and keep OpenDevStack resources in sync. Please see its https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor#installation[installation instructions] for your platform. The following lists the version requirements:

|===
| OpenDevStack version | Tailor version

| 3.x
| >= 1.2.0

| 2.x
| >= 0.13.1

| 1.2.x
| = 0.9.3

| 1.1.x
| = 0.9.3

| 1.0.x
| = 0.9.1

| 0.1.x
| = 0.8
|===

== Infrastructure

=== Atlassian Tools
At this stage you can setup the Atlassian tools if they do not exist yet, or modify them as needed.

WARNING: Documentation for this is missing.

After Crowd is running, ensure that there is a user corresponding to the `CD_USER_ID_B64`/`CD_USER_PWD_B64` parameters in `ods-core.env`.

=== OpenShift cluster
At this stage you can setup the OpenShift cluster if it does not exist yet.

WARNING: Documentation for this is missing.

TIP: If you are on Linux, `oc cluster up` will do the trick.

== Bitbucket Repositories

On Bitbucket, there must be an `OPENDEVSTACK` project filled with the necessary repositories such as `ods-core`. To set them up, use:

[source,sh]
----
make prepare-bitbucket-repos
----

Then, update them with the latest state so that they can be used e.g. from `BuildConfig` resources in OpenShift:
[source,sh]
----
make sync-repos
----

You also need to update `ods-configuration`, which can be done via:
[source,sh]
----
git remote add origin <bitbucket-ods-configuration-git-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
----

== OpenDevStack environment in OpenShift

=== Central ODS project

OpenDevStack needs one central project in OpenShift, which will hold all shared resources such as images or deployments. This project is typically called `ods`, but you can customize this in the configuration via `ODS_NAMESPACE`.

First, log into OpenShift with a user that has cluster-admin rights.
In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-ods-project
----


=== Nexus

A central Nexus deployment is used to proxy packages and to store artifacts.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-nexus
----

Afterwards, run the initial configuration:
[source,sh]
----
make configure-nexus
----

In the course of this you will be prompted to set a new admin password.

WARNING: The `configure-nexus` target is not idempotent yet, so it cannot be used for upgrading!

=== SonarQube

A central SonarQube deployment is used to analyze source code.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-sonarqube
----

This will launch an instance of SonarQube.
The script will prompt for a new admin password. Once this has been set, an auth token for the Jenkins pipelines will be generated.
Both values are automatically written into `ods-configuration/ods-core.env`, which you then need to commit and push.

Also, you have to add the cd-user as a user in the project permissions of your Bitbucket OpenDevStack project. Read permission is sufficient.

=== Jenkins

Central Jenkins images (master, agent, webhook proxy) are used by every ODS project.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-jenkins
----

Then, there are further Jenkins agent images for each quickstarter technology.

To create those images, run the following from `ods-quickstarters`:
[source,sh]
----
make install-jenkins-agent
----

=== Document Generation service
At this stage you can setup or modify the image stream for the Document Generation service.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-doc-gen
----

=== Provisioning Application
At this stage you can setup or modify the provisioning application.

In `ods-core` run:
[source,sh]
----
make install-provisioning-app
----


Congratulations! At this point you should have a complete ODS installation. Try it out by provisioning a new project with the provisioning application.
