== Introduction

Welcome to the OpenDevStack. The OpenDevStack is a framework to help in setting up a project infrastructure and continuous delivery processes on OpenShift and Atlassian toolstack with one click. This guide shall help you to setup the OpenDevStack, so you can work with it and test it in a local environment setup. The steps for the setup can also be adapted for running the OpenDevstack with an existing OpenShift installation or to connect it with your Atlassian tools, if you use https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd[Atlassian Crowd] as SSO provider.

*Important: The credentials provided in the guide are only meant to be used within the local test installation. For use in production you will have to customize paths, URLs and credentials!*

== Requirements

The following requirements have to be met to setup a local environment. You should have a computer with at least 32 GB of RAM, because we are going to install
several Atlassian tools and a local OpenShift environment.

*Important: We assume, you will have a full functional internet connection*

=== Git

We use Git as code repository, so you have to be familiar to work with https://git-scm.com/[Git].

=== Vagrant

The OpenDevStack uses Vagrant to provide a sample infrastructure for the Atlassian tools, Rundeck and a so called Ansible controller, a VM, where you can run Ansible scripts against the Atlassian VM. It is recommended to use the latest Vagrant version available from the https://www.vagrantup.com[HashiCorp Vagrant page].

=== Virtualbox

Vagrant uses Virtualbox for running the provisioned VMs. Therefore you must have https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtualbox] installed.

=== Atlassian tools licenses

To use the Atlassian tools you need a license to run them. For testing and evaluation Atlassian provides evalutation licenses, which you can get on the https://my.atlassian.com/products/index[My Atlassian license page].
Here you have to keep in mind, that you have to register, if you don't have an Atlassian account. The registration is for free.
You need licenses for the following products:

* Bitbucket
* Jira
* Confluence
* Crowd

The evaluation licenses are valid for 30 days from the date of purchase. If you need a server id, this will be provided by the tools within the installation,
so you are able to inlcude the licenses within theinstallation wizards of the tools, after the base setup provided by the Ansible scripts.

The base setup uses the following versions:

|===
| Software | Version

| Bitbucket
| 5.16.3

| Jira
| 7.13.3

| Confluence
| 6.14.3

| Crowd
| 3.4.4
|===

=== Cygwin / Linux

You must have the possibility to run bash scripts to install the OpenDevStack. On Linux systems you can use these scripts out-of-the box, on Windows systems you will have to install either a bash port for Windows like https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin].
For Windows, our recommendation is to use Cygwin for configuration. Make sure to select the curl package under the "net" category when installing cygwin.

=== Ansible

The OpenDevStack uses https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible] to install and configure the necessary software for the enabling stack, so it's recommended to get familiar with its core concepts and usage. Credentials are stored within an Ansible vault, so even if you commit them in a public repository they are not available unless you know the vault password. Nevertheless, it is recommended to take care with handling credentials, even if they are encrypted.

== Setup your local environment

From now on we assume, you work from a Bash (Cygwin / Linux).

=== Tailor

We use https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[tailor] to handle our versioned OpenShift templates and keep our cluster in sync. Please see its https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor#installation[installation instructions] for your platform. The following lists the version requirements:

|===
| OpenDevStack version | Tailor version

| 0.1.x
| = 0.8

| 1.0.x
| >= 0.9.1

| 1.1.x
| >= 0.9.3
|===

=== Prepare infrastructure

First create a base directory for the OpenDevStack repositories, e.g. *ods*. This will be your base directory for all following operations.
This path will also be mounted to the VMs provisioned by Vagrant.

Then you have to clone the http://www.github.com/opendevstack/ods-core[ods-core] repository into the created directory.

----
git clone https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core.git
----

image::documentation/setup-script/clone_repo.PNG[Clone repository]

Navigate to the folder menu:ods[ods-core > infrastructure-setup].

image::documentation/setup-script/scripts.PNG[Directory listing]

There you will find the setup and configuration shell scripts. You can start the infrastructure provisioning and setup by using

[source,shell]
----
./setup-local-environment.sh
----

This script allows you to set the necessary installation pathes, clones the necessary OpenDevStack repositories and prepares the vagrant infrastructure, including the base installation of the Atlassian tools, Rundeck and datatbase preparing.

For a local test environment it is recommended to keep the default values.

image::documentation/setup-script/script-execution-1.PNG[Configuration values]

image::documentation/setup-script/script-execution-2.PNG[Vagrant]

During script execution you will have the possibility to choose, if you want to confirm the Atlassian and Rundeck installation for every tool or to run a complete setup.

image::documentation/setup-script/stack-confirm.PNG[Atlassian stack]

After the base installation, you will have to configure the Atlassian tools, before you are able to proceed.

image::documentation/setup-script/script-execution-3.PNG[Vagrant]

image::documentation/confluence/confluence-permission-4.PNG[Set permissions]

Click *Save all* to persist the permissions.

=== Prepare local OpenDevStack environment

After the configuration of the Atlassian tools has been done, it's time to continue with the preparation oft the OpenDevStack environment.
In this step the basic configuration for the OpenShift cluster takes place, as well as the installation of Sonarqube, Nexus3 and the Provisioning application.
In addition Rundeck will be prepared automatically as far as possible.

Navigate to the *ods-core/infrastructure-setup/scripts* directory on your local machine and execute the script

`prepare-local-environment.sh`

image::documentation/prepare-script/directory-listing.PNG[Directory listing]

Now you will have to decide, which configuration should be done. In a first time installation you will have to keep the defaults.
For further customization there will be an additional guide.

*Important; The preparation script also activates SSO in Confluence and Jira. After the activation has been done a login with the local administrator credentials is no longer possible!*

image::documentation/prepare-script/activate-sso.PNG[SSO activation]

During the mirroring of the local repositories to your Bitbucket instance, it is possible, that you will be asked for credentials.
Here you have to enter the credentials for your loacl Crowd administrator or the `cd_user` credentials.

image::documentation/prepare-script/git-credentials.PNG[Git credentials]

After the repository mirroring you may setup project branch permissions in Bitbucket, if the `production` branch should be guarded against direct merges except through admins.

The subsequent paragraphs explain the installation and configuration content for Nexus3, Sonarqube, Rundeck and the Provisioning application.

==== Nexus3

Nexus3 will be installed automatically, if you have confirmed the installation in the prepare script.

After the installation Nexus3 will be accessible at http://nexus-cd.192.168.56.101.nip.io/

You are able to login with the default credentials for Nexus3 `admin` `admin123`.

During installation various resources will be created automatically. You will find their description in
the subsequent paragraphs.

===== Blob stores

In the automated installation the following blob stores will be created

|===
| Type | Name | Path

| File
| candidates
| /nexus-data/blobs/candidates

The account created is used to authenticate against Nexus3, anonymous access is disabled.

==== Sonarqube

By default Sonarqube will be installed with the preparation script.

You will have to pass a valid authentication token for Sonarqube to the OpenShift templates, so the script will pause as soon as Sonarqube is available.

image::documentation/sonarqube/pause-script.PNG[Paused preparation script]

Go to https://sonarqube-cd.192.168.56.101.nip.io .

image::documentation/sonarqube/sonarqube_login.PNG[Sonarqube Screen]

Login with your Crowd credentials.

image::documentation/sonarqube/sonar_qube_user.PNG[Login]

Now open your personal account settings.

image::documentation/sonarqube/sonarqube_my_account.PNG[My account]

Generate a token in the _Security_ section.

image::documentation/sonarqube/sonarqube_my_account.PNG[Generate token]

Copy the token value to the input of the preparation script and follow the instructions.
The token will be processed and integrated in the templates for future builds.

==== Prepare Jenkins slave docker images

In additon to the base Jenkins images you have the option to build additional Jenkins slave images.
To do so, just type `y` instead of typing `n` or pressing `Enter`, if you are asked, if you want to install the additional slave images.

==== Rundeck configuration

After the preparation script execution, you will have to configure some values in Rundeck.

Access Rundeck at http://192.168.56.31:4440/

Login with your Crowd credentials.

image::documentation/rundeck/rundeck-login.PNG[Rundeck login]

Now choose the _Quickstarters_ project.

image::documentation/rundeck/project.PNG[Project selection]

Open the *Job Actions* button on the right and *Import Remote Changes*

image::documentation/rundeck/remote-changes.PNG[Job actions]

Click *Import*

image::documentation/rundeck/import-remote-changes.PNG[Import changes]

Now you should see the imported jobs.

image::documentation/rundeck/jobs.PNG[Import changes]

Choose the *verify global rundeck settings* job and execute it to verify that Rundeck has all necessary data.

image::documentation/rundeck/verify-connections.PNG[Import changes]

===== Configure SCM Export plugin

If you use the Github repository, and use as is this step isn't necessary!

If you use your own repository, configure the export plugin in same way as the import plugin, except the file path template - set to `rundeck-jobs/${job.group}${job.name}.${config.format}`

=== Provisioning application

####Run from OpenShift
The Provisioning application has been installed with the environment preparation script and is accessible via

https://prov-app-test.192.168.56.101.nip.io

There is no further configuration needed.

If the application is not available, you will have to proof in OpenShift, if there have been any errors during the installation.

==== Run from IDE

Open the cloned provision application in your favorite IDE

If you run the application from your IDE, you will have to provide some addional informations.

In case you want to use your local Nexus, you will have to create a `gradle.properties` file in the ods-provisioning-app project to provide the Nexus credentials, because we disabled anonymous access.

[source,INI]
----
nexus_url=http://nexus-cd.192.168.56.101.nip.io
nexus_user=developer
nexus_pw=developer
----

You also have to ensure the Nexus certificate is integrated in the keystore of the JDK the IDE uses.

If you don't want to use the internal Nexus and run the application from your IDE, you will have to provide a `gradle.properties` file with the following content:

[source,INI]
----
no_nexus=true
----

After startup via the IDE the application is available at http://localhost:8080/

You can login in with the Crowd admin user you set up earlier.

=== Add shared images

OpenDevStack provides shared images used accross the stack - like the authproxy based on NGINX and lua for crowd

In order to install, create a new project called `shared-services`

Make the required customizations in the `ods-configuration` under menu:ods-core[shared-images > nginx-authproxy-crowd >  ocp-config > bc.env and secret.env]

and run `tailor update` inside `ods-core\shared-images\nginx-authproxy-crowd`:

and start the build: `oc start-build -n shared-services nginx-authproxy`.

== Try out the OpenDevStack

After you have set up your local environment it's time to test the OpenDevStack and see it working.
Open the Provisioning application in your web browser and login with your crowd credentials.

Provision your first project and have a look at your project in the Atlassian tools and OpenShift.
