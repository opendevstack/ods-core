# Test Fixtures

The JSON files in this directory correspond to the `repo:refs_changed`,
`pr:merged` and `pr:declined` event payloads that the webhook proxy is supposed
to handle. The sample payloads are taken from
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0511/using-bitbucket-server/managing-webhooks-in-bitbucket-server/event-payload.
